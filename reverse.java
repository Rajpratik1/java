// It seems you are trying to reverse an array in your `reverse1` method. However, there is an issue with the return type of the method. You have declared the return type as `int`, but you are returning an array. In Java, you cannot directly return an array from a method. Instead, you can modify the original array in place and use `void` as the return type. Here's the corrected code:

// ```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class reverse {

    static void reverseArray(int[] arr, int n) {
        int low = 0, high = n - 1, temp;
        while (low < high) {
            temp = arr[low];
            arr[low] = arr[high];
            arr[high] = temp;
            high--;
            low++;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Call the method to reverse the array
        reverseArray(arr, n);

        // Print the reversed array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
// ```

// Changes made:
// 1. Changed the return type of `reverse1` to `void` since you are modifying
// the original array in place.
// 2. Renamed the method to `reverseArray` to better reflect its purpose.
// 3. Removed the attempt to print the reversed array within the `reverse1`
// method, as printing should be done in the `main` method after calling the
// reverse method.
